                <p>
                    In 2018, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences attempted to introduce a Popular Film
                    category. The effort failed for multiple reasons, the main one being, you know, the Oscars aren’t
                    the People’s Choice Awards. Another, as pointed out by numerous critics, is there are still areas
                    of craft the Academy doesn’t recognize. Stunts, is one of them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the years, figures from the stunt community spoke out in favor of a Best Stunts category at
                    the Oscars to no avail. While Wade Eastwood, the stunt coordinator behind Mission: Impossible —
                    Fallout, isn’t personally “into awards or accolades,” he recognizes how crazy it is “that all these
                    huge action films get Oscars for costume, hair, make-up, visual effects, special effects, music,
                    acting, directing, etc., but not for the stunts or the stunt coordinating and choreography.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    “A lot of times the action is a major reason that the film is so successful,” he writes to EW over
                    email from New Zealand, “and in many cases it’s the coordinator/ 2nd unit director that writes the
                    action that everyone sees.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stunts do receive recognition from some awards ceremonies, mainly through the Screen Actors Guild
                    and the Taurus World Stunt Awards, but the Oscars constitutes a much larger stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “I feel, as a stunt performer, it’s always nice to be recognized by your peers,” Black Panther
                    stunt coordinator Jonathan Eusebio says. “Being honored by the Academy is the highest honor you can
                    get, but as a stunt person, I’ve always believed in we just do our work. We’re behind-the-scenes
                    guys and we just want to be part of a good movie.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, until the time comes when the Oscars recognizes Best Stunts (if ever), we’ll do it for them.
                    Here are some of the best movie stunts of 2018.
                </p>

                <figure class="movie-title">
                    <h3>Mission: Impossible — Fallout </h3>
                    <span><b>Standout stunt</b>: Halo jump</span>
                    <img class="movie-title-img" src="img/mission-impossible.png" alt="mission imnpossible video">
                </figure>

                <p>You can’t talk about Mission: Impossible — Fallout without addressing the time Tom Cruise leaped out
                    of an aircraft at 25,000 feet above the ground. He became the first actor to perform such a feat on
                    camera, and it was something Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie had been conceiving for
                    quite a while.</p>
                <p>“The action, most importantly, has to be story and character driven, otherwise it’s just action for
                    the sake of action, which I never want to do,” Eastwood says. In the story of Fallout, the crew
                    “needed a cool way to get Ethan [Cruise] and Walker [Henry Cavil] into Paris.”</p>
                <p>Cruise, an actor who famously performs his own stunts (no matter how totally nuts they may be),
                    performed “over a 100 jumps on camera to get the cut sequence,” according to the stunt coordinator.
                    Eastwood remarks, “We built the largest outdoor wind tunnel in the world at the studio so that
                    [Cruise], myself, and my team could rehearse the complex action moves in between other scenes being
                    shot and then transfer this to the skies later on.”</p>
                <p>Prior to the release of Fallout, McQuarrie teased something that would top the opening sequence of
                    the last movie, Rogue Nation — the one where Cruise dangles outside an airplane in the midst of
                    takeoff. The Halo jump was that thing.</p>

                    <h3>The Night Comes for Us </h3>
                    <span><b>Standout stunt</b>: All. Of. Them. (But particularly Julie Estelle’s apartment brawl)</span>
                    <img class="movie-title-img" src="img/the-night.png" alt="the night come for us video">
                </figure>

                <p>“Holy s—” is a phrase that comes to mind most often when watching The Night Comes For Us, one of the
                    best action movies of 2018, and also one of the straight-up goriest. (For that reason, we’re only
                    showing the trailer and not an actual clip from the movie.)</p>
                <p>The sequences just keep escalating. It starts with a backroom nightclub scuffle for actor and action
                    coordinator Iko Uwais to demonstrate once again why he’s one of the greatest talents the stunt
                    community has to offer, followed by a brutal, arm-snapping, meat-cleaver-slashing butcher showdown,
                    followed by an even more gratuitously gory display with a horde of South East Asian Triad henchmen
                    invading an apartment.</p>
                <p>Uwais, known for The Raid movies, choreographed the action. Underneath the gallons of fake blood
                    that no doubt went into making this movie, it demonstrates the precision and creativity that goes
                    into his craft. A close-cornered apartment face-off between Julie Estelle’s The Operator, a
                    mysterious woman on a mission to kill the leaders of the Triad, and two assassins could grow dull.
                    But sharp movements, three distinct fighting styles, guerrilla camera shots, and the transformation
                    of an air conditioner into a savage execution method keeps it lively.</p>

                <figure class="movie-title">
                    <h3>Black Panther</h3>
                    <span><b>Standout stunt</b>: Casino fight</span>
                    <img class="movie-title-img" src="img/black-panther.png" alt="the night come for us video">
                </figure>

                <p>Speaking of actors performing their own stunts, the casino fight scene in Black Panther with
                    Chadwick Boseman, Danai Gurira, and Lupita Nyong’o was “100 percent them,” according to Eusebio.
                    “In that scene, you can’t really cheat doubles. It’s all them.”</p>
                <p>The sequence, which took approximately four days to shoot, was initially mapped out as one
                    continuous take. “When we started designing that thing, there were a lot of factors involved. The
                    performers have to be pinpoint, the camera moves have to be pinpoint,” Eusebio notes. There were
                    “so many moving parts,” however, that they decided to make it at least “seem like a continuous
                    shot,” while figuring out “different ways to stitch it together so everything [felt] very
                    seamless.”</p>
                <p>The actors had already been training well in advance of shooting the scene, but there were still
                    challenges that arose the day of, as with most intricate stunts. The biggest obstacle for Eusebio
                    was going from rehearsing “individually” with the actors to rehearsing all together on set. That’s
                    when, because of “time constraints” with filming or just the fact that “sometimes things don’t
                    work,” adjusting on the fly is crucial.</p>
                <p>The results speak for themselves.</p>

                <figure class="movie-title">
                    <h3>Aquaman</h3>
                    <span><b>Standout stunt</b>: Rooftop chase</span>
                    <img class="movie-title-img" src="img/aquaman.png" alt="the night come for us video">
                </figure>

                <p>Whether you dubbed Aquaman a “vibrant ocean fantasy” or a “bloated, waterlogged film,” the stunt
                    team fought their way from the depths of the Trench to the throne of Atlantis. One sequence most
                    emblematic of director James Wan’s keen eye is the exhilarating chase between Arthur (Jason Momoa),
                    Mera (Amber Heard), Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), and a troupe of Atlantean commandos on the
                    roof tops of Sicily.</p>
                <p>As his half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) threatens to launch a war against the surface world, Arthur
                    and Mera journey across the Seven Seas to track down King Atlan’s lost trident to defeat him. In a
                    brief move to land, the film sees our heroes under attack by Black Manta, backed by Atlantean
                    forces. </p>
                <p>Many of the battle sequences were complemented by elongated shots, tracking the action from one
                    space to another. In the big chase, a crane-mounted camera began with Black Manta’s assault on
                    Arthur before zooming off to another end of the city where Mera dodged gunfire. Wan’s team tackled
                    multiple moving parts, including a Texas Switch (wherein one stunt double ducks behind something to
                    be replaced with another), a two-level chase, and visual effects to blend it all together.</p>

                <figure class="movie-title">
                    <h3>Game Night</h3>
                    <span><b>Standout scene</b>: Keep away</span>
                    <img class="movie-title-img" src="img/game-night.png" alt="the night come for us video">
                </figure>

                <p>Epic stunts aren’t always chase scenes and close combat. Attention must be paid to physical comedy.</p>
                <p>Amid the late-night shenanigans of the film Game Night, a group of friends gather for what they
                    think is a staged mystery-kidnapping experience for their regular game night, but it’s all in fact
                    real. They find themselves in various situations reminiscent of familiar kids games: Annie (Rachel
                    McAdams) has to pull a bullet out of Max’s (Jason Bateman) arm in a nod to Operation, Michelle
                    (Kylie Bunbury) and Kevin (Lamorne Morris) stack items on top of a chair Jenga style to escape a
                    locked room, and, in one of the center piece stunts, the gang find themselves in a game of Keep
                    Away with a Fabergé egg as henchmen pursue.</p>
                <p>The scene didn’t come together until the crew found the location: a mansion with multiple levels and
                    open balconies. Helmers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein and their team then went to stunt
                    coordinator and 2nd unit director Steve Ritzi to design something that would look like one
                    continuous shot wherein each cast member had a turn with the egg.</p>
                <p>“They basically gave me some general guidelines and then I went there with several stunt people and
                    started walking through different ideas and how can we make this continuous, and try to map a path
                    that would work for the sequence,” Ritzi says. Once he landed on the choreography, it was time to
                    put it to the test. He gathered his stunt team and recorded a “concept previz” to make sure it
                    worked. It did with the assistance of a camera zooming about the space on a cable and another
                    instance of a Texas Switch with a stuntman swapping in for Billy Magnussen to tumble down the
                    stairs.</p>
                <p>The principal cast rehearsed this sequence several times in rehearsal before deciding to just go for
                    it. The first time, they got halfway through before having to reset. Another time, the stunt guy
                    falling down the stairs lost control of the egg. In total, it was roughly “four or five” takes,
                    Ritzi says, before they caught it all on camera. </p>
                <p>It was grueling on the stuntman, though. “Each time we’re redoing it, he’s doing another stair
                    fall,” Ritzi laughs.</p>
